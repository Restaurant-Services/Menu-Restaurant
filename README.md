# Sushi-Restaurant

Working backend-less Menu application.

##Where does the idea come from?

Corona virus is the main reason, a friend of mine was scared about closing her
restaurant in this period, she is also pregnant than her concerns are twice than
the first lockdown.

She wasn't ready at all, she had to remove menus from the restaurant and the only
way she had to give menus to her guests was to share it on Facebook and Instagram.

Fun fact about me: I don't like Instagram! I tried it once and i see so many naked
girls.

I appreciate that pictures but I still remember Oak's words: "There's a time and
place for everything", and I guess that pictures and position should be on Porn sites.

After this little joke that I use to tell when someone asks my Instagram account,
now I want to talk about my choices!

##Why Angular

I'm a programmer, I like back-end and I used to work on back-end since my first job.

However, my company needs Angular programmers, then I also noticed that this language
allows to create a Backend less application, then I chose to start this new adventure.

For the Italian lockdown I couldn't celebrate my birthday, then I wrote this
application exactly on that week, during my free time and breaks.

##Why backend-less?

Backend-less means that there is no application behind the scene,
data is simply parsed on the website and sent to a Database without
processing data.

A Database that fulfill this purpose needs to comunicate with JSONs,
should receive a JSON and send a JSON in any communication, like MongoDB.

In this case, a menu is an easy application that doesn't require any kind
of calculations or conversions, it's really easy that a backend may be
not used at all.

##Is there a DB?

Not yet, at the moment there are many mock files.

I'm still looking for a MongoDB free host.

##Why these options?

The main reason is the Pandemic situation, in Italy we have many strict laws to
respect, many restaurants are not ready yet to face this situation.

And with this open source projects I want to create a free platform ready to use.

##Open Source means that no one gets paid?

Not at all, I didn't get money, for the economical crysis it's hard to get paid
from anyone for any kind of service, but this service is essential.

Then, this is a gift for everyone, no one will pay for use it!

But they must learn how to insert items into the mocks, it's simple but not
everybody can do that.

Here comes the "business" for my colleagues (and, if I'm lucky, for me too): 
* Host this app;
* Host the Database;
* Connect it to a Database;
* Mock the data.

I don't want to ruin the main business of many other colleagues, but
in this situation it's really hard to find new guests, here is a way to earn
a little bit less but without working soo hard.
